<p>Here is a <a href="thesis_website.pdf">link</a> to my bachelor’s thesis on M&amp;A activity.</p>
<div id="abstract" class="section level1">
<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>CEOs background’s, experiences and characteristics shape them into the person they are, and so play a role in their decision making process. On top of this, M&amp;A activity has become increasingly important in the strategic role of firms, and investigating how these decisions are made by the most important players is crucial. Hence I investigated the impact that tenure, education and being a shareholder or a member of the founding family had on a CEO’s propensity to engage in acquisitions. The results showed that an education in economics and being an owner-manager both have a positive impact on acquisition activity, while tenure appears to be insignificant.</p>

<p>I am also currently managing my parent’s portfolio and have an active interest in bonds and equity derivatives pricing.
The stock I am currently interested in is Airbus:</p>

<p>The reason I find Airbus so interesting is because it has not yet fully experienced the recovery.
Being mainly a European equity, it did not have the benefits of the federal reserve and massive bailouts
that were taking place in the US markets. Here are some of the pain points I have come across in my research of this company:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Increasing demographic and economic growth</li>
<li>People wanting to get back to travelling</li>
<li>Decreasing oil prices (about 10 USD PPB from before COVID) -&gt; strong negative correlation between the ppb and airline stock price</li>
<li>4% projected traffic growth over the next 20 years</li>
<li>39 200 projected new aircraft to be sold in 20 years</li>
<li>Continuously expanding is the aerospace and space exploration sector which is constantly gaining momentum</li>
<li>Defense sector also important part of their business</li>
<li>Traded in euros so resistant to upcoming inflation in us equity markets</li>
</ol>
