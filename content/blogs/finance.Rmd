Here is a [link](thesis_website.pdf) to my bachelor's thesis on M&A activity.

# Abstract

CEOs background’s, experiences and characteristics shape them into the person they are, and so play a role in their decision making process. On top of this, M&A activity has become increasingly important in the strategic role of firms, and investigating how these decisions are made by the most important players is crucial. Hence I investigated the impact that tenure, education and being a shareholder or a member of the founding family had on a CEO’s propensity to engage in acquisitions. The results showed that an education in economics and being an owner-manager both have a positive impact on acquisition activity, while tenure appears to be insignificant.

# Other Stuff
 I am also currently managing my parent's portfolio and have an active interest in bonds and equity derivatives pricing.
